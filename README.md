Tonatiuh
========

Tonatiuh is an Aztec sun-god, making it a somewhat appropriate name for some gliding analysis software (sort of). It's also a cool word imho.

This software is in its infancy at the moment, but the end goal is to be able to emulate the functionality of something like SeeYou. It currently runs locally within the web browser, only connecting to the internet for google maps.
